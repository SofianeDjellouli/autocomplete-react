You can clear both the input and the state with the `clearOnSelect` prop. This is useful to add selected items to a list. You can prevent the input to be focused on clear by passing the `focusOnClear={false}` prop. You can use this if you don't want to incite the user to add a new item to the list at some point.

```js { "file": "../index.js" }
```
